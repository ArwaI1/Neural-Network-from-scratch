# Neural Network Project Overview

## Dependencies
Requires NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib.

## Dataset
MNIST fetched via scikit-learn's fetch_openml.

## Architecture
Three-layer network: 784-input, 64-hidden (sigmoid), 10-output (sigmoid).

## Training
Splits dataset, initializes parameters, performs feedforward, applies backpropagation, and tracks accuracy.

## Evaluation
Tests network, prints accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Visualization
Plots test images with true and predicted labels.

## Code Structure
Notebook cells for library imports, activation functions, parameter initialization, feedforward/backpropagation processes, dataset splitting/label encoding, model training, test evaluation, and result visualization.

Execute cells in sequence from notebook top.
